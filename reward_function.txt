Explanation:

Reward Factors:
-	Influence of Current Score (Factor 1):
Reward: The reward is adjusted based on the change in the current score compared to the previous step, providing a smooth influence on the reward.

-	Game Completion (Factor 2):
Reward: If the game is completed (flag obtained), a reward of 350.0 is added; otherwise, a penalty of 50.0 is applied.

-	Power-ups Collected (Factor 3):
Reward: Add points for collecting power-ups (info['powerups_collected']).

-	Collecting Coins (Factor 4):
Reward: The reward is increased based on the number of coins collected (info['coins_collected']).

-	Stomping on Enemies (Factor 5):
Reward: The reward is increased based on the number of enemies stomped (info['stomped_enemies']).

-	Distance Traveled (Factor 6):
Reward: Encourage exploration by rewarding the agent based on the distance traveled.

-	Time Efficiency (Factor 7):
Reward: Encourage faster completion by rewarding the agent based on time efficiency.

-	Combo Multipliers (Factor 8):
Reward: Implement combo systems that provide increasing rewards for consecutive successful actions

Penalty Factors:
-	Collision with Obstacles (Factor 1):
Penalty: Deduct points for collisions with obstacles (info['obstacle_collisions']).

-	Incorrect Actions (Factor 2):
Penalty: Deduct points for unnecessary or incorrect actions.

-	Taking Damage from Enemies (Factor 3):
Penalty: The reward is decreased based on the amount of damage taken from enemies (info['damage_taken']).

-	Falling off Cliffs (Factor 4):
Penalty: The reward is decreased based on the number of falls off cliffs (info['falls']).

-	Idle Time (Factor 5):
Penalty: Deduct points if the agent remains idle for an extended period.
